# Tools

This repository contains a handful of shell scripts or other files
that may be useful for some Linux users.  As well I may reference
these scripts in some how-to guides that I plan to upload to other
repositories.

Here is a summary of the current tools:

  - **git-add-commit-ts.sh**
     - when adding existing files to git this script sets some git date
       environment variables so that the added files keep their timestamps
  - **git-touch.sh**
     - when you check out a repository this script sets the original
       file timestamps known to git
  - **system-backup.sh**
      - here is an example script for doing local system backups
  - **xt**
     - this is a happy xterm script that likes changing the xterm
       background colours.  It is best invoked by a window manager key
       sequence (like CONTROL-ALT-X) and dismissed with CONTROL-D, which
       is to say that some people prefer the keyboard over the mouse...
